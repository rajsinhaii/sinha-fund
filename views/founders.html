          We are originally from India and became Naturalized citizens of the United States of America in 1975. I came to the United States in 1962 for higher education; received two Master of Science degrees from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville and a PhD degree from the North Carolina State University, Raleigh.<br><br>

          Anju came with her family to Saint Louis, Missouri in 1967, where her father was a practicing physician. We met through a mutual friend, were married in St. Louis in 1969 and then lived in West Palm Beach, Florida.<br><br>

          We moved to Springfield, Illinois in 1972 and became a part of the Springfield community, Indian community in Springfield, Hope Church Family (from 1974). Our three children and two grand children have graduated from the Springfield High School. Also, as a part of the Hope Church family, we have opportunities to interact with Abundant Faith Church. Springfield is now our home.<br><br>

          We are seeing the fruits of education in people we have supported in the past. God has blessed us and we want to bless others by providing financial assistance, to the extent we can, so that they can realize the benefits of education in their lives.<br><br>
